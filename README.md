# NBkde

An R package for naive bayes using kernel density estimation.  

## Highlights
  - Classification prediction using naive bayes kernel density estimation 
  - Compute the pdf, cdf, p2norm of pdf, p2norm of cdf of kernel distributions
  - Compute the logloss, probabilistic squared loss and continuous rank probability loss for most kernel distributions 
  - Efficient implementation using to R and Rcpp 

  
## Installation

CRAN version:
```r
install.packages("NBkde")
```
